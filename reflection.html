    <h1>Personal Reflections</h1>
        <p>Reflecting on my career aspirations as a game designer with a focus on narrative design and cross-cultural literacy between Japan and the United States.

    My background as a cultural anthropologist and literary critical theorist has greatly influenced my approach to game design. My research on East Asian religions, particularly Taoism, Zen, and Shinto, has given me a deep understanding of the cultural and philosophical underpinnings that shape these societies. In addition, my experience as a former archaeologist has instilled in me an appreciation for storytelling and the power of narrative to create immersive experiences.</p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">As a game designer, my focus is on creating narrative-driven games that promote cross-cultural literacy. I believe that games have the potential to educate and inspire players, and I'm committed to leveraging this power to foster greater understanding and appreciation between Japan and the United States.</p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of game projects, each one teaching me something new about narrative design and game development. I'm proud of my work in designing compelling storylines that not only entertain but also educate players on different cultures and philosophies.</p>
    
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Looking ahead, my career goal is to continue designing narrative-driven games that promote cross-cultural literacy and to collaborate with like-minded individuals to bring these projects to life. Whether it's working with educators to develop educational games for the classroom or partnering with game studios to create innovative and culturally enriching games, I'm excited to be a part of a movement that uses games as a tool for positive change.</p>
