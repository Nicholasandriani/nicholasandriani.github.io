    <p><h3>Welcome to my portfolio.</h3> 
    </p>    
    Iâ€™ve selected the option to construct a portfolio as a portfolio would suit multiple ends and serve as a template for future growth and reiterations as I move throughout my diverse career interests.  The goals and objectives of this site remain true to my purpose to provide engaging and meaningful encounters between others and myself. I would like for this page to feel like an open dialogue and one that makes potential recruiters comfortable and at ease as they examine my credentials. The audience of this site include Professor Kueter, potential examinations from the faculty of the SISLT, and future recruiters. 
        On this website I will include a brief resume video, a statement about my educational and professional history, a link to my professional website, and a reflection on my previous research and experiences. I will provide CV via PDF attachment.
