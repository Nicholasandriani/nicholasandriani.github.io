    <h2>LTD Goals</h2>
    <p>The Learning Technologies and Design (LTD) program at the University of Missouri includes the following three competencies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Goal 1: Design and development of learning systems</li>
            <li>Goal 2: Front-end analysis and system evaluation</li>
            <li>Goal 3: Leadership & social responsibility</li>
        </ul> 
    <p>I aligned the program competencies with the following projects: Creating Learner-Centered Instructional Content: An ASK System, Wayback Machine Redesign, and OER Adoption Strategies for Adjunct and Full-time Faculty at Los Angeles Harbor College: Adding Quality OER into Courses.</p>

<h3 id="section-1">Project 1: Japanese to English Translation | 夢十夜夏目漱石第五夜</h3>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nicholasandriani/nicholasandriani.github.io/main/natsume%20sosekis%20ten%20nights%20of%20dreams%20cover.jpg" alt="natsume sosekis ten nights of dreams, or 夢十夜夏目漱石第五夜 " style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
<p>Translating Natsume Soseki's 夢十夜夏目漱石第五夜, the Ten Nights of Dreams, provded my most challenging service as a translator.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9flKvx5Z8yr-R6JGup2MfNpzn7u6pDJ/view">Creating Learner-Centered Instructional Content: An ASK System</a> project fulfills the LTD program’s first competency, <em>Design and Development of Learning Systems</em>. In <em>IS_LT 9474: Front End Analysis of Systems</em>, we created an ASK system around a topic. An ASK system assembles information as if discussing it with an expert with the intent of helping someone learn it. I used Microsoft PowerPoint to design an ASK system to help instructional designers write clear, concise, and consistent instructional content using plain writing, organization and structure, and content curation.</p>
<p>Translating Natsume Soseki's "Ten Nights of Dreams" has great value, both for literary and cultural reasons. As a literary work, "Ten Nights of Dreams" is a fascinating exploration of the human psyche, with each of the ten stories offering a unique perspective on the workings of the mind. The stories are rich with symbolism and imagery, and they offer a nuanced and complex exploration of themes such as identity, memory, and mortality. Translating this work into other languages allows readers from different cultural backgrounds to access this unique and compelling exploration of the human condition.
<p>Culturally, "Ten Nights of Dreams" is an important work because it is an example of early modern Japanese literature that has been translated and shared with a global audience. Natsume Soseki was a prominent figure in modern Japanese literature, and his works are considered to be some of the most important in the canon. By translating "Ten Nights of Dreams" into other languages, we are helping to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation for Japanese literature and culture. This, in turn, helps to foster greater empathy and connection between people from different parts of the world, and to promote a deeper appreciation for the diverse perspectives and experiences that make up our global community.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">Project 2: Narrative Design and Game Writing</h3>
<img src="../islt_7355/images/project2.png" alt="Wayback Machine Redesign" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
<p>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mn-tH69uSK1WcJ3QJyw5Dh46B0Cbh_eq/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100614981269223805903&rtpof=true&sd=true">Wayback Machine Redesign</a> fulfills the <em>Front-end Analysis and System Evaluation</em> competency. The Wayback Machine allows users to view archived versions of websites. The site’s unintuitive design makes the site difficult to use. In <em>IS_LT 9461: Interaction Design</em>, I worked with a group to design, develop, prototype, and evaluate a reimagined Wayback Machine.</p>

<p>The Wayback Machine Redesign included strong interaction design principles. We used Microsoft PowerPoint to create our lo-fi prototype; however, we encountered issues implementing those principles into our hi-fi prototype due to the limitations of the Justinmind prototyping tool. If our team had more time, we would have chosen a different prototyping tool to develop the design.</p>
<p>Due to difficulties with the tool, we created a <a href="https://youtu.be/9lSRggxsdtY">video walkthrough of the Wayback Machine Redesign</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section-3">Project 3: Nabatean Research and Excavation in Wadi Musa, Jordan</h3>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nicholasandriani/nicholasandriani.github.io/main/fieldwork%20in%20jordan.jpg" alt="Nicholas Rankin excavation in Wadi Musa, Jordan" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
<p>My interest in stoytelling led me to a career in archaeology. I am a specialist of Nabatean culture and pre-Islamic Arabia, and conducted the majority of my research on <em>Nabatean trade routes</em> and exchanges of material culture. <em>Storytelling contenvtions</em>we have come to see as common place were entirely novel back then and much of what we now recognize as so-called "Western" society was cemented within our psyche at this time. </p>

<p>My work centered around excavation of tradecamps along the Wadi Musa watershed, an area known for the  palasades carved into the sandstone walls of the slip canyons, or the city of Petra. I am proficient in GIS Mapping and Analysis, the archival handling of artifacts, and accession/cataloguing methodologiec. built our OER Institute using Microsoft Word (the schedule) and PowerPoint (slides). We included two presentations: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tsxxh9v-ERMvX6z9oB1mzoCxcvZAZnbS/view?usp=share_link">The Basics of Open Educational Resources (OER)</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cWaWGdM49JGvLJSWR-86wwkvyvtPl1j/view?usp=share_link">Searching for OER</a>. The project resulted in an accurate representation of the assignment requirements.</p>
