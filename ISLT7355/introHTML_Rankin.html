     Hello, everyone. I’m Nicholas. I am a graduate student on the Learning Technologies and Design track. I’ve returned to college after a decade working as an archaeologist and a freelance writer/translator. My experience with web development is limited to making minor arrangements on my website via WordPress. I also serve as a junior narrative designer on a handful of video games in development. A role that allows me to interact with the design team and experience their process. This course is my first step towards pursuing my dream job -- merging the roles of video game writer, narrative designer, and instructional technology developer. Ultimately, I am interested in working with the Pokémon Co. International marrying my skills in Japanese and passion for video game writing into a viable career. In my spare time I write poetry, and read feverishly! I enjoy obscure cuisine and come from a family of Romani musicians.
