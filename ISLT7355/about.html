        <h3>Learning Experience Designer and Game Writer</h3>
        <p>Hello, everyone. I’m Nicholas. I am a graduate student on the Learning Technologies and Design track. I’ve returned to college after a decade working as an archaeologist and a freelance writer/translator.
            <br>
        <br>My experience in web development is limited to the minor arrangements on my website https://nicholasandriani.org/. I have built and served as a web designer on a number of projects and presently work as a junior <em>narrative designer</em> and assistant writer on a handful of video games. I absolutely love storytelling roles that afford interactions between designers and developers. This course is my first step towards pursuing my dream job -- merging the roles of video game writer, narrative designer, and <em>learning experience designer</em> (LXD). Ultimately, I am interested in working with the Pokémon Company International marrying my skills in Japanese and passion for video game writing into a viable career. In my spare time I write poetry, and read feverishly! I enjoy obscure cuisine and come from a family of Romani musicians.</p>
