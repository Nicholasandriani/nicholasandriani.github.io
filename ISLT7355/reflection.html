    <h2>The Road So Far</h2>
    <p>I'm Nicholas Rankin, and my career experiences have revolved around my passion for literature and storytelling. I've worked as a writer, poet, narrative designer, and archaeologist, all driven by my love for stories and their ability to shape the way we view the world.</p>

        <p>As a writer, I've honed my skills in crafting narratives that engage readers and transport them to different worlds. I love weaving together complex characters, themes, and plots, and I believe that stories are a reflection of who we are as individuals and as a society. As a poet, I've delved deeper into the power of language and its ability to evoke emotion and paint vivid pictures in the minds of my readers.</p>
        
        <p>My work as a narrative designer has allowed me to use my love of storytelling to create immersive worlds for video games and interactive media. I believe that creating an experience for the audience is just as important as telling a story. My work as an archaeologist has also informed my approach to storytelling, as I recognize the significance of the stories we tell about the past in shaping our present and future.</p>
        
        Even in my free time, I pursue my love for literature and storytelling by translating poetry from Japanese to English. I believe that stories are not just entertainment, but an important reflection of our lives and experiences.
        
        Looking to the future, my career goals align with my passion for storytelling. I hope to continue writing and publishing my own work while also collaborating with others on narrative projects. I believe that by telling stories, I can make a positive impact on the world and help others see the importance of their own stories.</p>
  
    <p>I have lived in various places across the world, from Jordan to Spain, Texas to Missouri, and wherywhere I go I find that we're all alike in our longings, loves, and lives. So my goal in this life is to participate in bridging gaps between cultures and traditions.</p>
